# Caffeinated Beverages

## Description

The purpose of this project will be to analyze datasets that provide information on how much caffeine individual beverages contain along with consumption data of popular  beverages.  My plan is to join datasets that contain this information and develop questions based on the discovered information. The program will use Python and several packages that work with the language.   


## Features List

* Pandas for reading in CSV and URL data.  
* SQL for querying and joining the datasets.
* Seaborn, Matplotlib, and/or Tableu to plot visualizations
* Include instructions on how to activate the program.  This will include activating the virtual environment and using the requirements.txt file.
* I will create annotate the notebook by leaving descriptivemarkdown comments throughout  the code.
